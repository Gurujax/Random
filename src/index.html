    Learn More About Me:
  </h3>
  <p>
    I am a software support technician working at e-days Absence Management, a company that develops a web-based application for aiding companies in managing leave within their organisation.
  </p>
     
  <p>
    In my current position, I do not do much programming, except for SQL to manage our databases, however I am currently learning C#, .NET and HTML / CSS so I can move into a more development focused role.
